Project Title: AI Virtual Mouse

Project Description:
AI Virtual Mouse project is a dynamic and interactive application developed using cutting-edge technologies such as NumPy, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, all powered by the Python programming language. This project harnesses the power of computer vision and machine learning to enable users to control digital interfaces using hand gestures in real-time.

Key Features:

Hand Tracking: The application uses the MediaPipe library to perform real-time hand tracking. It accurately detects and tracks the user's hand movements and landmarks with impressive precision.

Gesture Recognition: Using NumPy and custom machine learning models, the application recognizes a variety of hand gestures. These gestures can include basic movements like open palm, closed fist, thumbs-up, and pointing fingers, as well as more complex gestures like peace signs or custom-defined gestures.

User Interface Control: Once a hand gesture is recognized, the application maps it to specific actions, enabling users to control digital interfaces. For example, a thumbs-up gesture might serve as a 'like' action in a social media app, while a pointing finger could be used to select and interact with on-screen elements.

Real-time Feedback: The project provides real-time visual feedback to users, highlighting detected hand landmarks and recognized gestures on the screen using OpenCV. This feedback enhances the user experience and aids in gesture refinement.

Customization: Users have the flexibility to define and train custom gestures, making the application adaptable for various use cases and applications.

Potential Use Cases:

Presentation Control: The project can be used to control presentation slides or multimedia content during lectures or business meetings.
Gaming: Gamers can use hand gestures for in-game actions and controls.
Accessibility: The application can be a valuable accessibility tool for individuals with mobility impairments, allowing them to interact with computers and digital devices more easily.
Technical Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, MediaPipe
Machine Learning: Custom gesture recognition models
Overall, the AI Virtual Mouse project showcases the convergence of computer vision, machine learning, and user interface design, offering an exciting and interactive way to interact with digital content using simple hand gestures. This project demonstrates the potential for intuitive and accessible user interfaces in a wide range of applications.
